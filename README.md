# 🔍 BiasLens – Ethical AI Bias Detection System

BiasLens is a full-stack Ethical AI application designed to detect, explain, and visualize bias in machine learning datasets and models.  
The project focuses on fairness, transparency, and responsible AI development by translating complex bias metrics into human-understandable insights.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📊 Dataset bias detection based on sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, age)
- ⚖️ Model fairness evaluation using group-wise performance metrics
- 🧠 Explainable AI (XAI) to identify why bias occurs
- 🛠️ Actionable bias mitigation recommendations
- 🎨 Clean and minimal dashboard UI for non-technical users

## 🧩 Why BiasLens?
Many AI systems silently inherit bias from historical data, leading to unfair outcomes.  
BiasLens helps developers, researchers, and students **identify bias early**, understand its root causes, and take corrective action before deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **ML & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Architecture:** Modular, explainable, and extensible

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Ethical AI audits
- Academic projects and research
- Fairness evaluation in healthcare, hiring, and finance ML models
- Learning tool for Explainable AI and Responsible ML

## 🌱 Future Scope
- Support for multiple sensitive attributes
- Advanced fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds)
- Interactive charts and dashboards
- Integration with real-world ML pipelines
